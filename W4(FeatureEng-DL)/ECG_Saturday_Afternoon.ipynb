This dataset contains 5,000 [Electrocardiograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography), each with 140 data points. You will use a simplified version of the dataset, where each example has been labeled either `0` (corresponding to an abnormal rhythm), or `1` (corresponding to a normal rhythm). You are interested in identifying the abnormal rhythms.\n","\n","Note: This is a labeled dataset, so you could phrase this as a supervised learning problem. The goal of this example is to illustrate anomaly detection concepts you can apply to larger datasets, where you do not have labels available (for example, if you had many thousands of normal rhythms, and only a small number of abnormal rhythms).\n","\n","How will you detect anomalies using an autoencoder? Recall that an autoencoder is trained to minimize reconstruction error. You will train an autoencoder on the normal rhythms only, then use it to reconstruct all the data. Our hypothesis is that the abnormal rhythms will have higher reconstruction error. You will then classify a rhythm as an anomaly if the reconstruction error surpasses a fixed threshold."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"i5estNaur_Mh"},"source":["### Load ECG data"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"y35nsXLPsDNX"},"source":["The dataset you will use is based on one from [timeseriesclassification.com](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=ECG5000).\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.408208Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.407921Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.795830Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.795151Z"},"id":"KmKRDJWgsFYa"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","# Download the dataset\n","dataframe = pd.read_csv('http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/ecg.csv', header=None)\n","raw_data = dataframe.values\n","dataframe"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.799351Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.798876Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.806296Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.805696Z"},"id":"UmuCPVYKsKKx"},"outputs":[],"source":["# The last element contains the labels\n","labels = raw_data[:, -1]\n","\n","# The other data points are the electrocadriogram data\n","data = raw_data[:, 0:-1]\n","\n","train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(\n","    data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=21\n",")\n","\n","#-->\n","train_data = torch.tensor(train_data, dtype=torch.float32)\n","test_data = torch.tensor(test_data, dtype=torch.float32)\n","train_labels = torch.tensor(train_labels, dtype=torch.float32)\n","test_labels = torch.tensor(test_labels, dtype=torch.float32)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"byK2vP7hsMbz"},"source":["Normalize the data to `[0,1]`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.809727Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.809284Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.834425Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-16T05:09:42.833790Z"},"id":"tgMZVWRKsPx6"},"outputs":[],"source":["min_val = torch.min(train_data)\n","max_val = torch.max(train_data)\n","\n","train_data = (train_data - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n","test_data = (test_data - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)\n","\n","train_data = torch.tensor(train_data)\n","test_data = torch.tensor(test_data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"BdSYr2IPsTiz"},"source":["You will train the autoencoder using only the normal rhythms, which are labeled in this dataset as `1`.
